## Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis

### Overview:
The goal of this analysis was to evaluate to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round.   Taking a look at months June and December were specifically called out by the stakeholder specifically focusing on temperature. 


### Results:
The results of the data is as follows:
- The Average Temperatures:    June-74, December-71
- The Maximum Temperatures:    June-85, December-83
- The Minimum Temperatures:    June-64, December-56

Lastly, one additional dataset to include would be the comaparison by weather station.  It would be best to take a look at stations in preferred locations.  We want to ensure that all locations are within same or similar ranges, otherwise there may be an opportunity to look at different locations or at some point expand.
